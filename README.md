# personal-site-v5
## The 5th generation of my personal website.

The main purpose of the site is to offer a portfolio of some recent things I've made (or worked on), and to include methods of contact (email and social links). It uses the MaterializeCSS framework, for the most part. Future enhancements might include: 
* single page to multi-page site
* design changes (quite likely)
* resume page
* animations and interactions
* blog/articles, possibly leveraging Jekyll
* API integration with Untappd and SoundCloud
